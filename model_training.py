    Implements a L-layer neural network. All layers but the last should have the ReLU activation function,
    and the final layer will apply the softmax activation function. The size of the output layer should be equal to
    the number of labels in the data. Please select a batch size that enables your code to run well (i.e. no memory
    overflows while still running relatively fast).
    :param X: the input data, a numpy array of shape (height*width , number_of_examples)

    :param layers_dims: a list containing the dimensions of each layer, including the input
    :param learning_rate: lr of the model
    :param num_iterations: epochs
    :param batch_size: the number of examples in a single training batch.
    :return: parameters – the parameters learnt by the system during the training
            costs – the values of the cost function (calculated by the compute_cost function).
            One value is to be saved after each 100 training iterations (e.g. 3000 iterations -> 30 values).
